# Hey there, I’m so glad you’re here!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
I’m passionate about growing in my career, picking up new tech skills, and making work life a *little* less overwhelming (and a lot more fun). Here, you'll find:

- 🛠️ Projects I’m building or contributing to
- 📚 Things I’ve learned while juggling work, deadlines, and debugging

Whether you're here to find useful code, get inspired, or just see how someone else is figuring it all out—you’re in the right place! 

**Let’s connect, learn, and grow together—one repo at a time.**  
You bring the snacks, I’ll bring the code💻
